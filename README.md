K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

Dataset:Iris Dataset

Objective
To implement and evaluate a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier using a normalized classification dataset.

Steps Performed:
**Dataset Selection & Preprocessing**
Selected a classification dataset.
Normalized the feature values to ensure equal contribution of all features.

**Model Implementation**
Used KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.
Trained the model on the training dataset.

**Hyperparameter Tuning**
Experimented with different values of K (number of neighbors).
Compared performance for various K values.

**Model Evaluation**
Evaluated the model using:
Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix

**Visualization**
Plotted decision boundaries to visualize how KNN separates different classes.
